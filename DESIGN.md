# The family look

How the light, list-and-form apps (Canvas, List, Mail, Places, Serve, Source,
Updater) are drawn, so they read as siblings of Charge and Books rather than
as stock Android with a coloured bar. The pieces live in `common/ui`
(`Family`, `res/drawable/family_*`, `res/values/family*.xml`); this is why
they look the way they do. Charge and Books keep their own looks.

## What Charge and Books get right

- A dark, quiet frame. The header is a deep colour and the status bar is the
  same colour, so the two read as one piece of chrome around a white page.
- One hue, used sparingly. Colour marks focus, the main action and the odd
  state (open, late, serving); everything else is near-black text on white
  with tinted greys.
- Hierarchy from weight and colour, not size. Two or three text sizes per
  screen, with Roboto Medium for what leads and a muted grey for what
  follows.
- One left edge. Every line of text starts 10dp in; hairlines are inset to it.
- Focus you can see at arm's length: a whole row lifted into a rounded card.
- Every screen says what to do next, including empty ones.

## The rules

1. **Four tones of one hue per app.** `primary` (the header and status bar,
   15 to 20% lightness), `focus_rule` (the accent, 35 to 40%), `focus_fill`
   (a wash near 95%) and greys (`divider`, `text_muted`, `field_fill`)
   tinted toward the hue. Semantic colours are fixed across the family:
   green `#1E7B34` for open or done, red `#B3261E` for late or failed, gold
   `#C58A00` for a star.
2. **Colour means something.** The accent appears on focus, on the one main
   action, and on what is new or actionable (an unread time, an update's
   target version, a phone number). Nothing is coloured to decorate.
3. **Three sizes.** Header 15sp Medium; lead text 13.5sp; secondary 11.5 to
   12sp. Titles of a detail page 16sp Medium. Emphasis is Roboto Medium
   (`Family.MEDIUM`), never bold.
4. **One edge.** Text at 10dp. List hairlines (`family_divider`) start there.
5. **Focus is a card.** `family_focus` (or `family_pick` for lists whose
   typing box keeps the focus): 4dp in from each side, 8dp corners, the wash
   with a 1.5dp accent outline. The text does not move when it lands.
6. **Fields are soft.** `family_field`: a tinted, borderless 30dp pill with
   its label inside, turning white with the accent outline while it takes
   the keys. A form that is a list of lines (Mail's composer) uses
   `family_line_field` rows instead.
7. **Say what to do.** Empty screens use `Family.empty`: a short title and,
   under it, the key to press. A status screen shows its main action as a
   `FamilyButton`, not only in the Menu.
8. **No header names the app.** You just opened it. A header says where
   you are or how things stand (a folder, "Up to date"), and a screen with
   nothing like that to say has no header at all. Nor does a screen carry
   a counter (items, results) for its own sake.
9. **Grouped pages for details.** A detail or status screen (a place, an
   assignment, Serve) sits on `grouped_page` with its facts on white
   `family_card`s, 6dp from the edges, a muted label over each value.

Stock dialogs use `FamilyDialog` (rounded, sentence-case buttons in the
accent) and popup and context menus `FamilyPopupMenu` (rounded, over the row
they are about). The theme's `colorControlHighlight` is `highlight`, the
accent at about 14% opacity, so the item under the d-pad is washed in the
app's hue without hiding anything. A view that takes the focus only so keys
land somewhere (a `ScrollView`, an empty state) turns off the platform's
default focus highlight (`defaultFocusHighlightEnabled="false"`), which
would otherwise lay that wash over the whole page.

## The palettes

| App | primary | on_primary_dim | focus_rule | focus_fill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | `#45142A` | `#D3AEBE` | `#8E1F48` | `#F9EEF3` |
| List | `#23201C` | `#C7B9A6` | `#A85C00` | `#FBF2E5` |
| Mail | `#4D1711` | `#DBB3AC` | `#A12C1D` | `#FCEFEC` |
| Places | `#0F3624` | `#A3C6B2` | `#1D6A45` | `#EAF5EF` |
| Serve | `#0D3236` | `#9CC3C6` | `#11707A` | `#E7F4F5` |
| Source | `#291741` | `#BBA9D3` | `#6334A3` | `#F2EDFA` |
| Updater | `#1B2633` | `#A8B6C6` | `#2B5E92` | `#EAF1F8` |

Each pair was checked for contrast: the dim header text is at least 7:1 on
its header, the accent at least 4.5:1 on its wash, and muted text at least
4.8:1 on white.
